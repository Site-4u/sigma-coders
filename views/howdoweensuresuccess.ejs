        <h2>How Do We Ensure success?</h2> 
        <p>
            At Sigma Coders we do not leave our student to learn how to succeed. Many other programming
            tutors often just let the student suffer, that is why the interest of many learners quickly depletes.
            At Sigma Coders we explain the importance of how and why we need to succeed. We also back this
            via our teacher which have been extensively interviewed and provided proper training to
            help new comers with their first lines of code.
