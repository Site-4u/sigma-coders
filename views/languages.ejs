        <p>
            People often want to learn how to develop a game, website, app or whatever it is that they want to develop, but almost nothing can be made with just 1 languages. Thus people learn many languages at one time often referred to as "Packages". Below this are listed some common packages and the use of each. Further below that we have brief summaries of each language we teach at Sigma Coders. Many people also wonder where they should start programming, well the answer depends on what you want, if you have no clue simply just contact us for guidance with the button below.

                    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
